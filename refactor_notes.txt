1. Probably want additional toplevel directories for embedded software and things other than just the device drivers.
2. let's move the tortuga code to drivers as well, same logic, we'll have to write/add to a make file but that's ok.We should put the binaries wherever
       Greg has put his. 
3. Let's move most of the variables in the qubo_node superclass to the individual class definitions. I think that will improve readability and make it easier to do sanity checks
4. We can get rid of the publish method, we'll take care of publishing inside of update, I agree with most of you guys that it makes more sense.
5. I REALLY don't like the way ram_cpp_utils is layed out.
6. We need to make sure we have really good error detection for all of the nodes we've written so far.
7. We should really go through and remove any use of raw pointers, I know many of us have a EE or cmpE backround
   but it'll probably come back to bite us..
8. consistent variable/function/class naming conventions are a must
